# vl53l5cx_neopixel_demo

A simple example application demonstrating the 8 x 8 depth map produced by the VL53L5CX. [Getting Started with the VL53L5CX ToF Sensor](https://forum.digikey.com/t/getting-started-with-the-vl53l5cx-tof-sensor/20900) explains how to create the corresponding STM32 configuration for this code. For a detailed description of controlling NeoPixel LEDs with STM32 devices, see [Controlling NeoPixels with STM32](https://forum.digikey.com/t/controlling-neopixels-with-stm32/20527).
